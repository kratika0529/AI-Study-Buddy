Of course. A great README.md file is a crucial part of your final submission. It's the first thing the evaluators will see and should clearly explain your project, its features, and how to run it.

Based on the assignment requirements and all the features you've built, here is a complete and professional README.md file. You can copy and paste this content directly into the README.md file in your GitHub repository.

AI Study Buddy - AI Agent Prototype
Name: Kratika Singh

University: [Your University Name]

Department: [Your Department Name]

üöÄ Project Overview
AI Study Buddy is a comprehensive, multi-page web application designed as an AI agent prototype for a software engineer internship assessment. The project's core mission is to automate and enhance the daily tasks of a university student by providing a suite of intelligent, interactive, and personalized tools.

This application was built to fulfill the core task of creating an AI agent that can reason, plan, and execute. It goes beyond the mandatory requirements by implementing a wide range of advanced features, focusing on a robust system design, a polished user interface, and a positive social impact for students.

‚ú® Key Features
The application is a full-stack solution built with Python and Streamlit, featuring a secure, persistent backend and a dynamic, user-friendly frontend.

Core AI Agent & Planner
Automated Study Planning: Users can add tasks with specific dates, times, and priorities.

Google Calendar Integration: The agent executes the plan by automatically syncing created tasks to the user's personal Google Calendar.

Interactive Calendar Dashboard: A modern, two-panel dashboard provides a visual overview of the user's schedule, with color-coded events and the ability to filter tasks by clicking on a date.

Persistent Task Management: All tasks and their completion status are saved for each user, so the plan is remembered even after logging out.

Advanced AI Assistants
Unified AI Chat: A conversational AI assistant, powered by the Google Gemini API, that can answer questions and remember the context of the conversation.

Persistent, User-Specific Chat History: Every conversation is saved privately for each user. Users can view, continue, or delete past conversations.

Empathetic Mental Health Companion: A dedicated chatbot with a supportive persona designed to provide a safe space for students to discuss study-related stress and well-being.

Operational & Security Features
Secure User Authentication: A complete login/sign-up system ensures that all user data is private. Passwords are securely hashed and never stored in plain text.

Secure Document Locker: A private vault where users can upload important documents.

Password-Based Encryption: Files are encrypted with a key derived from the user's password, making them unreadable to anyone else.

Download Confirmation: Requires the user to re-enter their main login password to confirm their identity before decrypting and downloading a file.

Polished UI/UX Design
Custom Landing Page: A beautiful, animated splash screen that welcomes the user and introduces the AI agent.

Customizable Color Themes: A sleek, in-app color picker allows users to personalize the application's appearance with a variety of light and dark themes.

Interactive Dashboards: The planner and stats pages feature interactive charts and progress bars to visualize the user's progress.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Framework: Streamlit

Language: Python

Data Visualization: Plotly, Pandas

External APIs:

Google Gemini API (for AI reasoning)

Google Calendar API (for task execution)

Security: cryptography library for file encryption, hashlib for password hashing.

Data Storage: Local JSON files for persistent, user-specific data storage (users, plans, chats, documents).

‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Application Locally
To run this project on your local machine, please follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd [your-project-folder-name]
Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

Bash

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required libraries:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your secret keys:

Create a folder in the main directory named .streamlit.

Inside that folder, create a file named secrets.toml.

Add your Gemini API key to this file in the format: GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_key_here".

Place your Google Cloud credentials.json file in the main project directory.

Run the Streamlit application:

Bash

streamlit run Home.py
The application should now be running and accessible in your web browser.
